## Branching and Tagging Model

We use the [git-flow] workflow to that extend, that branch
names(paces) have a certain meaing:

Branch Name Pattern | Description
--------------------|------------
`master`            | tip of the `master` branch is always the latest stable release
`development`       | tip of the `development` branch is the current state of development and not expected to be stable or even usable
`feature/*`         | various feature branches are used to implement new features and should be based off the `development` branch
`release/*`         | a release branch is created from the `development` branch and used to prepare a new release and will be merged into `master`
`hotfix/*`          | hotfix branches are based off `master` or `development` to fix important and severe bugs and should be merged into `development` and `master` as soon as possible

Releases and release candidates are tagged in the form
`release-X.Y.Z(-RCa)`, where `X`, `Y`, and `Z` specify the version
with respect to [semantic versioning] and `a` the number of the
release candidate of that version.


## Commit Messages

To ease browsing the proejct's history, we try to keep our commit
messages clean and descriptive.  Please try to follow the following
rules as best as possible:

* Commit Title must not be longer than 50 characters

  If applicable, the title should start with a category name (such as
  `docu`, `tests`, ...)  followed by a colon (e.g. `"docu: add usage
  examples for plain SDC"` ).

* Commit Description must have line wraps at 72 characters

* Please *sign* your commits (i.e. use `git commit -s`)

  This automatically appends a line of the form `"Signed-off-by:
  Torbj√∂rn Klatt <t.klatt@fz-juelich.de>"` to the end of the commit
  message.


## How to Implement a New Feature?

-# create a fork/clone
-# switch to the `development` branch and pull in the latest changes
-# create a new branch `feature/XYZ` where `XYZ` is a short title of
   your planned feature (word seperation should be done with
   underscores, e.g. `feature/my_awesome_feature`)
-# hack and write Unit Tests
-# commit
-# repeat steps 4 and 5 until you feel your feature is in an almost
   usable state and most of the unit tests pass
-# write documentation for your feature
-# push your feature branch
-# stay tuned on reviews, remarks and suggestions by the other
   developers
